Self-Gratitude (OPTIONAL ASSIGNMENT)
Make a gratitude list and acknowledge your accomplishments over the past few months.
I may not have finished the course as quickly as I initially hoped, but I’ve made consistent progress and kept moving forward — and that matters. I’ve learned a lot, grown more confident in my coding skills, and stayed committed to my goals.
I’m excited to continue improving and becoming a more efficient developer. I’m grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow, and I’m looking forward to the next course and challenges ahead!
