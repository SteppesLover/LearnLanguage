Time to look back and look forward: When you started this particular class we asked you why you wanted to be a software developer and what you wanted to do with your skills after the class ends. Have your answers changed? What are your answers now?
Honestly, my answer is still the same: I want to become a skilled software developer. That goal hasn’t changed — if anything, it’s become even clearer.
What is your plan for the next:
3 months?
I plan to complete this course, then the Node.js course, and possibly take on a practicum. If I feel ready, I’ll also begin preparing for job interviews.
1 year?
I hope to grow into a confident and capable developer, ideally with a stable job in the industry.
5 years?
I want to start an educational initiative to help people in developing countries learn how to code and build tech careers. It’s important to me to give back and create access to opportunities.
